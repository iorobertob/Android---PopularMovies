This is an Android App that searches the Movie DB for a list of films and sorts a grid array of posters thumbnails to display upon launch. 

When the user clicks on a poster the details of such film are shown.  

To use, an API key should be added to the NetworkUtils.java file, since it has been removed for its release on github.
